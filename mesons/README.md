- Code for NP10 mini project.
- A lot of the code was prewritten by others.
- Majority of the data is stored on Oxford Physics computers (50Gb>); I have one file that I copied using scp (~1Gb), but this is only a portion of even the smallest file! (jpmm0d_stripped.root)
-  Paths in JPsiLab.h must be amended to point to the data files!!
