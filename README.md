# oxford-physics-labs
Series of physics-based data analysis projects, which I received a practical commendation for “excellence of laboratory practical work”.

Projects include investigations into:
- superconductivity (Python, Jupyter Notebook)
- the magnetophonon effect (Python, Jupyter Notebok)
- B mesons produced in proton-antiproton collisions (C++)
- colour magnitude diagrams (R, R Markdown)
- chaos (MATLAB)
